# VIBE·FLOW

> We turn one line into a release-ready 1080p knowledge video: frames drawn by code,
> audio synthesised deterministically, and a **pixel-level QA gate** that decides
> whether the film is allowed to ship.

**This release serves one audience: solo video creators and people growing a new channel.**
One person handles the topic, the film and the publish, with no editor, designer or
engineering colleague — and no second pair of eyes. We replace that second pair with
measurements. Every input and runtime stays available (a topic line, a paper PDF or a
repo README; 8–180s) but behind one single pipeline. Free, local, no team, no server,
no paid service. Full product definition: [docs/24-MVP.md](docs/24-MVP.md).

## 1. Why we built it this way

| Problem | Our answer |
|---|---|
| A model says a frame looks fine while a caption is cut off | 11 pixel-level QA metrics, `avg < 8 → exit 1` stops the line |
| Frame density depends on taste, so quality drifts | Aesthetics become measurements: texture energy, composition centre, accent focus, subtitle occupancy |
| One changed frame means re-rendering everything | `render(t)` is a pure time function — identical SHA256 per frame, re-render by the second |
| Nobody knows where a long run got stuck | Every run writes `pipeline_report.json`: stage timings, artifacts, failed stage |

## 2. What is actually built

| Capability | Implementation | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Frame capture | `pipeline/render/render_frames.mjs` (CDP fast mode) | 0.65 → **0.13 s/frame** (4.9×), 1080p30 |
| QA gate | `pipeline/qa/qa_check.py` (QA v4) | 11 metrics, style-aware safe area, avg ≥ 8 to pass |
| Audio | BGM + six-effect whitelist + edge-tts narration + RMS side-chain ducking | Three-layer mix, −14 LUFS assembly |
| Content lines | Topic / paper PDF / repo README → `SCENE-PLAN.json` | All three share 100% of the back half |
| Component library | `pipeline/blocks/` — 10 blocks + `registry.json` score archive | Every block QA-gated |
| Brand contract | `pipeline/palette.json` (`palette_name` references) | Only QA-passed palettes admitted |
| Human review | `pipeline/review.mjs` | Scene grid, A/B comparison, QA issue overlay |
| Run report | `pipeline/report/generate.py` | Written on success **and** failure; append-only event log |
| Regression | `test_edge_v4.py` + `test_generate.py` + `_probe` | 15 assertions in CI |

## 3. Architecture

```
topic line / paper PDF / GitHub repo
   ↓  brief contract + validator
SCENE-PLAN.json ──(validate_plan.py: 11 hard checks)──→ build_html.mjs
   ↓  10 blocks assemble into one HTML file
render_frames.mjs ──(CDP frame capture)──→ frames/*.png
   ↓
qa_check.py ──(11 metrics / avg ≥ 8 gate, stop on failure)──→ qa.json
   ↓
BGM + SFX + TTS ──(mix_audio.py ducking)──→ build.ps1 (ffmpeg) ──→ final.mp4
   ↓
generate.py ──→ pipeline_report.json ／ review.mjs ──→ human review
```

`pipeline/run_all.ps1` chains everything: render → QA gate → BGM → SFX/narration → mix →
assembly → report. Exit codes `0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4` point at the failing stage.

## 5. Quick start (three MVP steps)

To confirm this release runs — steps 1 and 2 need neither Chrome nor ffmpeg:

```bash
python scripts/verify.py                 # 1) all checks PASS = MVP READY
```

```powershell
powershell -File scripts\setup.ps1       # 2) read-only environment / file health check
powershell -File pipeline\run_all.ps1 -Project projects\demo-hook-compound -SkipRender
                                       # 3) ship: QA gate + audio + assembly + run report
```

Drop `-SkipRender` and pass `-Duration <seconds>` for a full render, then read
`pipeline_report.json`. The product definition is in [docs/24-MVP.md](docs/24-MVP.md);
everything planned for later lives in [docs/25-ROADMAP.md](docs/25-ROADMAP.md) and does not
block this release.

Requires Python 3.10+ (`numpy` / `pillow` / `edge-tts`), Node 20+, a local Chrome, and ffmpeg.
No GPU and no paid connector required.

> **Custom model endpoint**: the main model is no longer locked to DeepSeek-Flash.
> Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `LLM_BASE_URL` / `LLM_API_KEY` / `LLM_MODEL`
> to plug in almost any image-capable text model (OpenAI-compatible vision models go
> through an OpenAI→Anthropic gateway such as litellm / one-api).
> `scripts/env.ps1` loads `.env` into the toolchain. See `.env.example`.

python ..\..\pipeline\qa\qa_check.py frames --fps 30 --json qa.json

The site is a single static file — open `site/index.html` offline, or run `python site/check.py`
as a pre-publish check.

## 6. Quality and observability

- **QA v4** detects safe-area bleed relative to each film's own background: dark films catch
  bright spill, light films catch dark spill. `--v2` / `--legacy-edge` reproduce older verdicts
  on the same frames (`docs/20`).
- **Run reports** carry stage timings, a QA summary, byte counts for 8 artifact classes,
  `verdict` and `failed_stage` — including when the QA gate blocks the run (`docs/21`).
- **One source of truth for checks**: CI runs only `python scripts/verify.py`, covering
  version sync, active-maintenance files, syntax, the plan gate, assemble smoke,
  two regression fixtures and the site self-check. Local and CI never drift; the
  frozen archive is deliberately outside the check, and new blocks/docs/films need
  no registration.
- **Honest limits**: 1920×1080 landscape only. Some methodology rules are observations, not
  controlled A/B results. Portrait was tested and deliberately dropped — we do not list it as a
  roadmap promise.

## 7. Reference films

<img src="docs/demo.gif" width="720" alt="demo-hook-entropy · 8s clip, fully generated"/>

| Film | Line | Runtime | QA |
|---|---|---|---|
| demo-hook-entropy | Four-layer composition baseline | 8s | 9.1 |
| demo-hook-compound | SCENE-WRITER + narration + SFX | 11.43s | 8.8 |
| paper-shannon1948 | PAPER2VIDEO explainer | 23.81s | 9.5 |
| paper-shannon-deep | PAPER2VIDEO long form | 180s | 9.2 |
| project-vibeflow | PROJECT2VIDEO self-showcase | 50s | 9.1 |

All five run on **one pipeline** — only the input source and runtime differ (8–180s);
they are not five product lines. Scores come from each film's `qa.json` on the actual
rendered frames (short-film scores are item-for-item equivalent across v2/v3/v4).
Frames, audio and videos are regenerated locally and are not committed.

## 8. Who it's for · how to get it

**One audience: solo video creators and people growing a new channel.** One way to get it:

| | |
|---|---|
| You get | The full open-source repo (MIT), running locally — no account, no telemetry, no server |
| It costs | Nothing. No subscription, no token markup; only your own model API usage and compute |
| Custom work | Open an issue or discussion. No quote tiers, no scheduling, no delivery promise |

Integration, Managed series and discovery-call pricing have been removed from all outward
material — they do not fit solo creators. See [docs/22-COMMERCIAL.md](docs/22-COMMERCIAL.md).

## 9. Documentation map (active / frozen)

**Active maintenance** (version-synced, in CI, guaranteed to run): both READMEs,
[docs/22](docs/22-COMMERCIAL.md) positioning, [docs/24](docs/24-MVP.md) MVP definition,
[docs/23](docs/23-RELEASE.md) release checklist, `site/`, the single pipeline and
`scripts/verify.py`.

**Frozen archive** (kept in the repo for rollback; no outward promise, no CI, no version sync):

| Range | Topic |
|---|---|
| 00–09 | Inventory, model profile, flash playbook, style DNA, failure modes, layer templates |
| 10–11 | Gap analysis, engine decision |
| 12–15 | Extra contracts for SCENE-WRITER / narration / PAPER2VIDEO / PROJECT2VIDEO |
| 16–21 | Project summary, SFX, brand contract, QA v3 / v4, run reports |
| 25 | Optional roadmap (not part of acceptance, never blocks a release) |

No file is deleted. Frozen material can be reactivated, but its maintenance cost is
assessed first (`docs/24`, section 6).

## 10. Legal and maintenance

- Self-authored parts: [MIT](LICENSE); upstream style metrics follow their own licenses (see the
  notice at the end of LICENSE).
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md): disclosure, credential discipline, local-only no-telemetry model,
  dependency list · [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): community standard.
- Every GitHub push increments `VERSION`, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, and ships a matching annotated
  tag — CI enforces it. Full checklist: [docs/23-RELEASE.md](docs/23-RELEASE.md).
